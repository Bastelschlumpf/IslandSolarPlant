### Some thoughts about security

- The solar panels are protected against lightning strikes by an overvoltage protection.
- The parallel connected solar panels are protected by a blocking diode so that the current does not flow into the other series connection.
- Directly after the solar panels a circuit breaker is installed in the garage so that the solar voltage can be disconnected from the grid on site.
- The solar connection line in the basement also has a circuit breaker so that the solar voltage can also be disconnected in the basement.
- The solar charge controller has reverse polarity protection, overload protection and temperature protection and also switches off automatically in case of other errors.
- The battery monitor monitors the battery voltage, charge and discharge current, as well as the midpoint voltage and temperature of the battery bank.
- The inverter has overvoltage protection, undervoltage protection and temperature monitoring.
- The batteries have an integrated battery management system. This protects each battery from overvoltage, undervoltage, overtemperature and undertemperature below 0 degrees Celsius.
- In addition, the battery management system also protects against short circuit.
- The battery bank can be disconnected from the system by a power disconnect switch.
- The battery bank connection is protected by a 100A fuse from the system.
- The power switching relay circuit and the supply voltage of the battery monitoring system is protected against short circuit by a 1A fuse.
- The output of the inverter is protected against fault currents by a RCD fuse.
- The output of the inverter can be remotely disconnected from the grid via a power monitoring system via Wifi.
- According to the installation connection standard and so that the RCD is functional, one phase of the inverter is defined by means of grounding to a defined potential.
- The complete system sends its status data to a home control system (IoBroker).
- An E-Ink display shows all important system data and statistics.
- The circuit is fireproof mounted on a Fermacell panel.
- The connections with higher voltage are covered finger-safe.
- A fire alarm is mounted in the basement room.
- Furthermore, a special extinguisher for lithium-ion batteries is mounted in some distance.


I hope I have not overlooked anything fundamentally important.
